Git is a distributed version control system
Git is free software distributed under the GPL
Git has a mutable index called stage
Git tracks changes of files
Creating a new branch is quick AND simple
Talk is cheap, show me the code
Where there is a will, there is a way
To be or not to be, that is a question.
